-Counted unique mouse ID

For “Get the duplicate mice by ID number that shows up for Mouse ID and Timepoint” input I got some suggestions from Ryan C. to use unique and loc and ended up figuring out just by using unique in a print.  Output is a bit different than in the starter but the right mouse ID is returned.
